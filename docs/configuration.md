# Configuration

How to configure the Device Manager to be able to connect to devices.

---

## Python Code

The Device Manager can be instantiated without any connections defined. Devices
can then be added to the Device Manager directly in the python code. Specific
configuration options can also be changed during runtime.

```python
# fmt: off
--8<-- "examples/miscellaneous/adding_devices.py"
```

See the [Example Usage](basic_usage.md) for more usage examples.

Also see the [`DeviceManager`][tm_devices.DeviceManager] API reference.

---

## Config File

Use a yaml (or toml) configuration file to avoid hard coding specific devices
into your scripts. The config file stores a list of device entries and runtime
behavior options.

The file allows you to set up a list of devices once and is easy to edit when
things change, but does not require modification with every script execution.

A config file can be **overruled** by an
[environment variable](#environment-variable) configuration. That means that if
you have both a config file defined and the environment variables set, the
config parser will **always** prioritize the environment variables. Make sure to
delete the environment variables if you want to switch back to the config file.

### Config File Path

The default location for the config file should be in the current working
directory:

`./tm_devices.yaml`

If an alternative path to the config file is needed, set the environment
variable:

`TM_DEVICES_CONFIG=<path_to_config_file>`

### Select a Pre-Configured Device from Device Manager

The Device Manager will look for any pre-configured devices and options on
instantiation and immediately open connections with all of them. Each device is
assigned a device number which can be used to recall a reference to that device.
Device numbers (1, 2,...) are determined sequentially by device type. That is,
the first SCOPE found will become "SCOPE 1", the second "SCOPE 2", etc.

Relying on device numbers means relying on order of declaration when working
with multiple devices of the same type. To avoid that, you are encouraged to
declare a unique name in the `alias` field with each device. Selecting your
device then looks like the code below:

```python
# Given a config file with a device entry with alias="custom_alias"
from tm_devices import DeviceManager

with DeviceManager() as device_manager:
    my_device = device_manager.get_device(alias="custom_alias")
```

#### Legend for Device Configuration

- `device_type`
    - Valid options for `<device_type>`:
        - `AFG`: An Arbitrary Function Generator
        - `AWG`: An Arbitrary Waveform Generator
        - `DAQ`: An Data Acquisition Unit
        - `DMM`: An Digital Multimeter
        - `MT`: A Margin Tester
        - `PSU`: A Power Supply Unit
        - `SCOPE`: An Oscilloscope
        - `SMU`: A Source Measure Unit
        - `SS`: A Systems Switch
- `connection_type`
    - Defaults to `TCPIP` when not explicitly defined.
    - Valid options for `<connection_type>`:
        - VISA connection types:
            - `TCPIP`: A VISA connection over the TCPIP interface (default)
            - `USB`: A VISA connection over a physical USBTMC interface
            - `SERIAL`: A VISA connection over the serial (ASRL / RS-232 / RS-485) interface
            - `SOCKET`: A VISA connection over the SOCKET interface
            - `GPIB` : A VISA connection over the GPIB interface
        - Other valid connection types:
            - `REST_API`: A REST API connection over the network
- `address`
    - `<ip_address_or_hostname>`
        - Either the full IP address or system hostname is required to initialize
            the connection to the device.
        - Hostname is preferable, since it will gracefully handle a new DHCP lease
            which results in a potentially new IP address, but sometimes hostnames
            have resolution problems. In that case, an IP address usually works.
    - `<model>-<serial_number>`
        - If using the `USB` connection type for a VISA connection, address must be
            specified in the format `<model>-<serial_number>` so that the proper VISA
            resource expression can be created.
    - `<serial_port>`
        - The COM port to use, usually a number. For example, an usb-to-serial
            adapter connected to the USB port number 1 would show up as "COM1", so
            `address='1'`.
    - `<gpib_address>`
        - The GPIB address, a number in the range 0 to 30.
- `alias`
    - An optional field for a case-insensitive string that can be used as a key to
        select the device in the Device Manager instead of the device type and
        number. Without an alias, the device can still be accessed through a key
        generated from `<device_type>` string and the number of devices of the same
        type that were defined before it. For example: If there are two SCOPEs in
        the device list, one should be `SCOPE 1` and the other should be `SCOPE 2`.
    - Underscores and dashes are allowed, but other special characters are not
        allowed. Any alias provided will be converted into all capital letters for
        use later.
- `lan_port`
    - The open port, a number in the range 0 to 65535.
    - Required when the `<connection_type>` is `SOCKET`.
    - Optional when `<connection_type>` is `REST_API`
- `serial_config`
    - Configuration data for `SERIAL` connection type, which VISA documentation
        commonly refers to as ASRL.
    - **Both sides must be using the same settings, otherwise data looks like
        gibberish.**
        - `baud_rate:` The baud rate controls the communication frequency:.
            - Common rates: \[115200, 57600, 38400, 19200, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200,
                600, 300\].
            - Different products may support ranges outside the commonly used rates
                listed here.
        - `data_bits:` The number of data bits in each character.
            - One of \[5, 6, 7, 8\].
        - `flow_control:` Control for pausing/resuming data stream between slower
            devices.
            - Valid options: `none`, `xon_xoff`, `dtr_dsr`, or `rts_cts`
        - `parity:` Parity controls checksum bit (added to each data character)
            behavior.
            - Valid options: `none`, `odd` ,`even`, `mark`, or `space`.
        - `stop_bits:` Number of bits to use to indicate end of a character.
            - Valid options: `one`, `one_and_a_half`, or `two`.
        - `end_input:` Character(s) to indicate the end of a message transmission.
            - Valid options: `termination_break`, `termination_char`, `last_bit`, or
                `none`.
- `gpib_board_number`
    - The GPIB board number (also referred to as a controller) that the device is connected to.
    - If no board number is provided in the configuration, a board number of `0` is assumed.
- `device_driver`
    - The name of the Python driver class to use for the device (see the
        [`tm_devices.drivers`][] API reference for a complete list of all driver
        names).
    - Required when `<connection_type>` is `REST_API`
    - Ignored when `<connection_type>` is not `REST_API`

### Config Options

These options are flags that enable/disable runtime behaviors of the Device
Manager.

#### Yaml Options Syntax

```yaml
options:
  verbose_mode: false
  verbose_visa: false
  standalone: false
  setup_cleanup: false
  teardown_cleanup: false
  retry_visa_connection: false
  check_for_updates: false
```

These are all `false` by default if not defined, set to `true` to modify the
runtime behavior configuration.

- `verbose_mode`
    - This config option will turn on more printouts to stdout.
- `verbose_visa`
    - This config option will turn on extremely verbose VISA logging to stdout.
- `standalone`
    - This config option specifies to use the PyVISA-py VISA backend, which
        does not require any actual visa.dll to exist on the system to work.
    - By default, the Device Manager will default to using whatever visa.dll it
        can find on the system.
- `setup_cleanup`
    - This config option will make the Device Manager run a cleanup on setup, so
        devices will get reset on connection.
- `teardown_cleanup`
    - This config option will make the Device Manager run a cleanup on teardown,
        so devices will get reset on close.
- `retry_visa_connection`
    - This config option will enable a second attempt when creating VISA connections,
        the second attempt is made after waiting, to allow the device time to become available.
- `check_for_updates`
    - This config option will enable a check for any available updates on pypi.org for the
        package when the `DeviceManager` is instantiated.

## Environment Variable

Two environment variables, `TM_OPTIONS` and `TM_DEVICES`, can be used for
runtime configurations and have a **HIGHER** priority than the config file.

- `TM_OPTIONS` is a comma-delimited, all-uppercase list of enabled options
    names.
- `TM_DEVICES` is a `~~~`-delimited list of device entries.
    - Each device entry is a comma-delimited list of `<key>=<value>` pairs.

The main benefit of the environment variables over a config file is for
convenience in load-balanced or dynamic setups. For instance, in headless
execution scenarios where the list of devices needs to be temporary and
workspace variables can be changed easily per script executor.

There is no mechanism for merging the options and devices between the two config
methods; if either of the `TM_DEVICES` or `TM_OPTIONS` environment variables is
defined, the config file is ignored. If the environment variable(s) exist,
either permanently or temporarily, for the lifetime of the shell instance, they
will override any existing config file you have.

### Sample Environment Variable

Sample environment variable device configurations (with comments, not allowed in
environment variable)

```python
# Sample SMU using IP address and PyVISA-py
TM_OPTIONS = "STANDALONE"
TM_DEVICES = "address=123.45.67.255,device_type=SMU"

# Sample scope using hostname and AFG using IP address with cleanup
TM_OPTIONS = "SETUP_CLEANUP,TEARDOWN_CLEANUP"
TM_DEVICES = "address=MDO9876-C543210,device_type=SCOPE~~~address=123.45.67.255,device_type=AFG"

# Sample scope using IP address and AWG using hostname
TM_DEVICES = "address=123.45.67.255,device_type=SCOPE~~~address=AWG9876-C543210,device_type=AWG"

# Sample scope using IP address and port for socket connection
TM_DEVICES = "address=123.45.67.255,connection_type=SOCKET,device_type=SCOPE,lan_port=4000"

# Sample scope using USBTMC with an alias
TM_DEVICES = "address=MSO58-300026,alias=my-alias,connection_type=USB,device_type=SCOPE"

# Sample Margin Tester using IP address
TM_DEVICES = "address=123.45.6.789,connection_type=REST_API,device_type=MT,device_driver=TMT4"
```
