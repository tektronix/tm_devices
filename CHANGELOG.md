## Unreleased

Things to be included in the next release go here.

### Added

- Added the constraint ranges for all signal generators
- Added drivers for AWG and AFG channels
- Added a property named `source_channel` in AWG's and AFG's.
- Added drivers for the internal AFG in TekScopes.
- Added a property named `internal_afg` in TekScope.
- Added implementation of `generate_function` for all AWG models.
- Added two burst functions to `SignalGeneratorMixin`: one to set up burst and one to generate the burst by forcing trigger.
    - NOTE: Only the AFGs and Internal AFGs have these functions implemented.
- Added `OutputSignalPath` enum attribute in AWGs representing output signal path options.
- Added two functions for loading waveform set files in the AWG70k and AWG5200 drivers: one for loading a waveform set file and another for loading a specific waveform from a waveform set file.
- Added `sample_waveform_set_file` attribute in the AWG70k and AWG5200 drivers to define the default waveform set file.

### Changed

- <span style="color:red">BREAKING CHANGE</span>. Changed the term "signal source" to "signal generator".
    - All uses of this term are changed. Import paths now use `signal_generator` instead of `signal_source`.
- <span style="color:red">BREAKING CHANGE</span>. Changed the function name of `generate_waveform()` to `generate_function()`.
    - `generate_waveform()` only exists on AWGs now, however the functionality is entirely changed.
- <span style="color:red">BREAKING CHANGE</span>. Changed the `generate_function()` function by removing burst functionality.
    - Any use of burst now must use `setup_burst()` and `generate_burst()` instead.
- Updated AWGs such that the `family_base_class` is at the series level.
