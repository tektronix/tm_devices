    """The ``*SRE`` command.

    Description:
        - The ``*SRE`` (Service Request Enable) command sets and queries the bits in the Service
          Request Enable Register. For more information, refer to Registers.

    Usage:
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``*SRE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``*SRE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``*SRE value`` command.

    SCPI Syntax:
        ```
        - *SRE <NR1>
        - *SRE?
        ```

    Info:
        - ``<NR1>`` is a value in the range from 0 through 255. The binary bits of the SRER are set
          according to this value. Using an out-of-range value causes an execution error. The
          power-on default for SRER is 0 if ``*PSC`` is 1. If ``*PSC`` is 0, the SRER maintains the
          previous power cycle value through the current power cycle.
