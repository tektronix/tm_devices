              ``CH<x>_D<x>`` or CH<x> _DALL, when the ``:DATa:WIDth`` is 1, the returned data is
              state only. When the ``:DATa:WIDth`` is 2, the returned data is transition data with 2
              bits per digital channel representing the transition information as follows: 0 0 low 0
              1 high 1 1 multiple transitions in interval ending with high 1 0 multiple transitions
              in interval ending with low For individual digital channels (such as ``CH<x>_D<x>`` ),
              ``:DATa:WIDth 2`` provides the 2-bit transition data with the upper 14 bits zero.
              ``:DATa:WIDth 1`` provides only the state in the LSB with the upper 7 bits all zero.
              For ``CH<x>_DAll`` sources, ``:DATa:WIDth 2`` provides the 2-bit transition data for
              each of the 8 constituent channels with the D7 bit represented in the 2 most
              significant bits, D6 in the next 2, and so on. ``:DATa:WIDth 1`` provides the states
              of each of the 8 constituent channels with D7 represented in the most significant bit
              and D0 in the least significant bit. Depending on the sample rate, multi-transition
              data may not be available and ``:CURVe?`` queries for digital channels with
              ``:DATa:WIDth 2`` may result in a warning event 'Execution warning: Multi-transition
              data not available'. In this case, the transition data returned will be 0 0 or 0 1.
              For MATH sources, only 8-byte double precision floating point data is returned in
              ``:CURVe?`` queries. A Fast Acquisition waveform Pixmap data is a 500 (vertical) by
              1000 (horizontal) point bitmap. Each point represents display intensity for that
              screen location. 500 (vertical) which is the row count in the bitmap, might vary based
              on how many channels enabled from same FastAcq group. To query and get the Fast Acq
              Pixel Map data, the following command set should be sent: ``ACQuire:FASTAcq:STATE ON``
              ``DATA:MODe PIXmap`` When the FastAcq is on, Curve? on Ch<x> will return pixmap data
              (if ``DATA:MODe`` is PIXmap). The number of rows in the pixmap will vary based on how
              many ch<x> sources are turned on and how they are grouped in acquisition HW. The
              grouping can vary from model to model. The number of columns in pixmap data is fixed
              to 1000. For example, on a MSO58 instrument, Ch1 to Ch4 is 'group1' and Ch5 to Ch8 is
              'group2'. If Ch1 is turned on (in group1) then Ch1 rows will be 500. If Ch2 and Ch3
              are turned on (in group1) then Ch2 and Ch3 rows will be 250 each. When all Ch1/2/3/4
              are turned on (in group1) then 125 rows per channel. If Ch1 (in group1) and Ch8 (in
              group2) are turned on then 500 rows will be returned for each channel. To calculate
              the number of rows, you can use- (number of bytes from curve header/``BYT_NR``)/1000.

        **Description:**
            - This query-only command continuously transfers waveform data from the instrument as it
              is acquired. This command puts the instrument into a streaming data mode, allowing the
              controller to receive waveform records as fast as they are acquired. Use the
              ``DATA:SOURCE`` command to specify the waveform sources. The command supports all the
              same data formatting options as the CURVE command. Control of the instrument through
              the user interface or other external clients is not allowed while in streaming data
              mode. The GPIB controller must take the instrument out of this streaming data mode to
              terminate the query and allow other input sources to resume communication with the
              instrument. The following options are available to transition out of streaming data
              mode: Send a device clear over the bus Send another command or query to the instrument
              Turning the waveform screen display mode off ( ``:DISplay:WAVEform OFF`` ) may
              increase waveform throughput during streaming mode. Using a data encoding of SRIbinary
              ( ``DATa:ENCdg SRIbinary`` ) may also increase the waveform throughput since that is
              the raw native data format of the oscilloscope. While in streaming data mode, two
              extreme conditions can occur. If the waveform records are being acquired slowly (high
              resolution), configure the controller for a long time-out threshold, as the data is
              not sent out until each complete record is acquired. If the waveform records are being
              acquired rapidly (low resolution), and the controller is not reading the data off the
              bus fast enough, the trigger rate is slowed to allow each waveform to be sent
              sequentially.
