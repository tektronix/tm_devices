    """The ``*SRE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - The ``*SRE`` (Service Request Enable) command sets and queries the bits in the Service
          Request Enable Register. For more information, refer to Registers.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``*SRE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``*SRE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``*SRE value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - *SRE <NR1>
        - *SRE?

    **Info:**
        - ``<NR1>`` is a value in the range from 0 through 255. The binary bits of the SRER are set
          according to this value. Using an out-of-range value causes an execution error. The
          power-on default for SRER is 0 if ``*PSC`` is 1. If ``*PSC`` is 0, the SRER maintains the
          previous power cycle value through the current power cycle.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets and queries the bits in the Event Status Enable Register (ESER). The
          ESER prevents events from being reported to the Status Byte Register (STB). For a more
          detailed discussion of the use of these registers, see Registers.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``*ESE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``*ESE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
