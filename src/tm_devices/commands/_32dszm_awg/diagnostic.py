    """The ``DIAGnostic:SELect`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command selects the self-test routines. The query form of this command returns the
          selected test routine. The following selections are available: ALL FPANel - Front panel
          read/write access test DTIMing - Data timing measurement (for AWG5000 series only)
          AREGister - AWG register read back A1Memory - CH1 waveform memory test A2Memory - CH2
          waveform memory test A3Memory - CH3 waveform memory test (for AWG5000 series only)
          A4Memory - CH4 Waveform memory test (for AWG5000 series only) CREGister - Clock register
          read back CPLock - PLL Lock/unlock O1Register - Output1 register read back O1ALevel -
          Output1 analog level O1MLevel - Output1 Marker level (for AWG7000 series only) O2Register
          - Output2 register read back O2ALevel - Output2 analog level O2MLevel - Output2 marker
          level (for AWG7000 series only)

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``DIAGnostic:SELect?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``DIAGnostic:SELect?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``DIAGnostic:SELect value`` command.

        - This command executes all of the NORMal diagnostic tests. The query form of this command

          values of 0 for no errors or -330 for one or more tests failed. This changes the active
          mode to DIAGnostic, if necessary, and returns back to the original active mode when done.
