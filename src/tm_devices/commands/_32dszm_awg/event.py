    """The ``EVENt:POLarity`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command and query sets or returns the polarity of event signal. The Event Jump is the
          function to change the sequencing of the waveform by an event signal.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``EVENt:POLarity?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``EVENt:POLarity?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``EVENt:POLarity value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - EVENt:POLarity {POSitive|NEGative}
        - EVENt:POLarity?

    **Info:**
        - ``POSitive`` indicates that event jump occurs when the instrument receives a positive
          pulse.
        - ``NEGative`` indicates that event jump occurs when the instrument receives a negative
          pulse.

        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``EVENt:LEVel?`` query and raise an

          more information on jump timing.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``EVENt:JTIMing?`` query.
