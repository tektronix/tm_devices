    """The ``ACQuire:STOPAfter`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries whether the instrument continually acquires acquisitions or
          acquires a single sequence. Pressing SINGLE on the front panel button is equivalent to
          sending these commands: ``ACQUIRE:STOPAFTER SEQUENCE`` and ``ACQUIRE:STATE 1``.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

        - ACQuire:STOPAfter {RUNSTop|SEQuence}
        - ACQuire:STOPAfter?

    **Info:**
        - ``RUNSTop`` specifies that the instrument will continually acquire data, if
          ``ACQuire:STATE`` is turned on.
        - ``SEQuence`` specifies that the next acquisition will be a single-sequence acquisition.
    """


class AcquireState(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``ACQuire:STATE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Starts or stops acquisitions. When state is set to ON or RUN, a new acquisition will be
          started. If the last acquisition was a single acquisition sequence, a new single sequence
          acquisition will be started. If the last acquisition was continuous, a new continuous
          acquisition will be started. If RUN is issued in the process of completing a single
          sequence acquisition (for example, averaging or enveloping), the acquisition sequence is
          restarted, and any accumulated data is discarded. Also, the oscilloscope resets the number
          of acquisitions. If the RUN argument is issued while in continuous mode, acquisition
          continues.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STATE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STATE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STATE value`` command.

    **Usage:**

class AcquireMode(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``ACQuire:MODe`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Sets or returns the acquisition mode of the oscilloscope for all live waveforms. Waveforms
          are the displayed data point values taken from acquisition intervals. Each acquisition
          interval represents a time duration set by the horizontal scale (time per division). The
          oscilloscope sampling system always samples at the maximum rate, so the acquisition
          interval may include than one sample. The acquisition mode (which you set using this
          ``ACQuire:MODe`` command) determines how the final value of the acquisition interval is
          generated from the many data samples.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``ACQuire:MODe?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:MODe?`` query and raise an

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - ACQuire:MODe {SAMple|AVErage}
        - ACQuire:MODe?

    **Info:**
        - ``SAMple`` specifies that the displayed data point value is the first sampled value that
          is taken during the acquisition interval. In sample mode, all waveform data has 8 bits of
          precision. You can request 16 bit data with a CURVE query but the lower-order 8 bits of
          data will be zero. SAMple is the default mode.
        - ``AVErage`` specifies averaging mode, in which the resulting waveform shows an average of
          SAMple data points from several separate waveform acquisitions. The oscilloscope processes
          the number of waveforms you specify into the acquired waveform, creating a running
          exponential average of the input signal. The number of waveform acquisitions that go into
          making up the average waveform is set or queried using the ``ACQuire:NUMAVg`` command.
