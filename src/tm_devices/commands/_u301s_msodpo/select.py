    **Description:**
        - Turns on and off the display of the reference waveform <x>. The <x > variable represents
          the reference channel number, which can be 1-4. The query returns whether the channel is
          on or off.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``SELect:REF<x>?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``SELect:REF<x>?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
