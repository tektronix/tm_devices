          reference waveform) between two waveforms. The measurement is made between the middle
          reference points of the two waveforms and is expressed in degrees, where 360° represents
          one waveform cycle.

          50%) amplitude points of a positive pulse. The measurement is made on the first pulse in
          the waveform or gated region.
        - ``RISe`` timing measurement finds the rise time of the waveform. The rise time is the time
          it takes for the leading edge of the first pulse encountered to rise from a low reference
          value (default is 10%) to a high reference value (default is 90%). This measurement is
          available only on DPO models.
        - ``RMS`` amplitude measurement finds the true Root Mean Square voltage in the entire
          waveform or gated region. This measurement is available only on DPO models.

              gated region. This measurement is available only on DPO models.
            - ``MINImum`` finds the minimum amplitude. This value is typically the most negative
              peak voltage. It is measured over the entire waveform or gated region. This
              measurement is available only on DPO models.
            - ``NDUty`` (negative duty cycle) is the ratio of the negative pulse width to the signal
              period, expressed as a percentage. The duty cycle is measured on the first cycle in
              the waveform or gated region.
            - ``Negative Duty Cycle = ((Negative Width) / Period) × 100%``
            - ``NEDGECount`` is the count of falling edges.
            - ``NOVershoot`` (negative overshoot) finds the negative overshoot value over the entire
              waveform or gated region. This measurement is available only on DPO models.
            - ``Negative Overshoot = ((Low - Minimum) / Amplitude) × 100%)``
            - ``NPULSECount`` is the count of negative pulses.
            - ``NWIdth`` (negative width) measurement is the distance (time) between the middle
              reference (default = 50%) amplitude points of a negative pulse. The measurement is
              made on the first pulse in the waveform or gated region.
            - ``PDUty`` (positive duty cycle) is the ratio of the positive pulse width to the signal
              period, expressed as a percentage. It is measured on the first cycle in the waveform
              or gated region.
            - ``Positive Duty Cycle = ((Positive Width / Period) × 100%``
            - ``PEDGECount`` is the count of rising edges.
            - ``PERIod`` is the time required to complete the first cycle in a waveform or gated
              region. Period is the reciprocal of frequency and is measured in seconds.
            - ``PHAse`` measures the phase difference (amount of time a waveform leads or lags the
              reference waveform) between two waveforms. The measurement is made between the middle
              reference points of the two waveforms and is expressed in degrees, where 360°
              represents one waveform cycle.
            - ``PK2Pk`` (peak-to-peak) finds the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum
              amplitude in the entire waveform or gated region. This measurement is available only
              on DPO models.
            - ``POVershoot`` is the positive overshoot value over the entire waveform or gated
              region. This measurement is available only on DPO models.
            - ``Positive Overshoot = ((Maximum - High) / Amplitude) ×100%``
            - ``PPULSECount`` is the count of positive pulses.
            - ``PWIdth`` (positive width) is the distance (time) between the middle reference
              (default = 50%) amplitude points of a positive pulse. The measurement is made on the
              first pulse in the waveform or gated region.
            - ``RISe`` timing measurement finds the rise time of the waveform. The rise time is the
              time it takes for the leading edge of the first pulse encountered to rise from a low
              reference value (default is 10%) to a high reference value (default is 90%). This
              measurement is available only on DPO models.
            - ``RMS`` amplitude measurement finds the true Root Mean Square voltage in the entire
              waveform or gated region. This measurement is available only on DPO models.
