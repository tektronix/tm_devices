class RecallWaveform(SCPICmdWrite):
    r"""The ``RECAll:WAVEform`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command (no query form) recalls a stored waveform to a reference location. This
          command is equivalent to selecting Recall from the File menu, and then pressing the
          Waveform button.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``RECAll:WAVEform value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - RECAll:WAVEform <file path>,REF<x>

    **Info:**
        - ``<file path>`` specifies a location for a stored waveform file. <file path> is a quoted
          string that defines the file name and path. Input the file path using the form
          ``<drive>:<dir>``/<filename>.<drive> and one or more <dir>s are optional. If you do not
          specify them, the instrument will read the waveform from the default directory
          (C:UsersPublicTektronixTekScope\|Waveforms). <filename> stands for a file name of up to
          128 characters (use of wildcard characters in filenames is not supported). File name
          extensions are not required but are highly recommended.
        - ``REF<x>`` specifies a location in internal reference memory. Reference memory location
          values range from 1 through 4.
    """


class RecallSetup(SCPICmdWrite):
    """The ``RECAll:SETUp`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Restores the state of the oscilloscope from a copy of the settings stored in memory. The
          settings are stored using the ``*SAV`` command.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``RECAll:SETUp value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - RECAll:SETUp {FACtory|<NR1>|<file path>}

    **Info:**
        - ``FACtory`` restores the factory setup.
        - ``<NR1>`` is a value in the range from 1 to 10, which specifies a saved setup storage
          location.
        - ``<file path>`` specifies a location for an oscilloscope setup file. <file path> is a
          quoted string that defines the file name and path. Input the file path using the form
          <drive>:/<dir>/<filename>.<extension> and one or <dir>s are optional. If you do not
          specify them, the oscilloscope will read the file from the default directory (see
          ``FILESYSTEM:CWD``). <filename> stands for a filename; the use of wildcard characters in
          filenames is not supported. Filename extensions are not required, but highly recommended.

        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``RECAll?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
