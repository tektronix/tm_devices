    **Description:**
        - Stores the state of the oscilloscope to a specified memory location. You can use the
          ``*RCL`` command to restore the oscilloscope to this saved state at a later time.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``*SAV value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - *SAV <NR1>

    **Info:**
        - ``<NR1>`` specifies a location in which to save the state of the oscilloscope. Location
          values range from 1 through 10. Using an out-of-range location value causes an execution
          error. Any settings that have been stored previously at this location will be overwritten.
