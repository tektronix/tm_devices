class CounterType(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``COUnter:TYPe`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Sets or queries the Counter Application type as Trigger Source Frequency or A-B Trigger
          Time Interval. The Trigger Source Frequency Application is commonly referred to as
          Frequency Counting, and measures the frequency of the trigger source over a large number
          of events to obtain a very accurate result. The A-B Trigger Time Interval Application
          measures the A-Event to B-Event in an A->B Sequence Trigger, over a single A->B Trigger
          Sequence. DPO70000SX Series only. This command is optional.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``COUnter:TYPe?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``COUnter:TYPe?`` query and raise an

        - ``FREQuency`` sets the application type to time interval. The default value is Frequency.
    """


class CounterState(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``COUnter:STAte`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Enables the Trigger Source Frequency or A-B Trigger Time Interval application, depending
          on the value of the ``COUnter:TYPe`` parameter. This command sets or queries the Counter
          State enumerated value (OFF/ON) used to enable/disable the display of frequency or time
          information in the graticule area or in the Results Table. The Trigger Source Frequency
          Application uses trigger hardware, rather than the acquired waveform, to measure the
          frequency of the signal on the trigger source to a very high precision. Best results are
          obtained when the External Reference is tied between the instrument and the source of the
          trigger signal. As a result of using the trigger hardware, the measurement update rate is
          very fast, 1/3 second by default. An A-Event Edge to B-Event Edge A->B Sequence must be
          used. Statistics are derived from the measured values: Minimum, Maximum, Average (mean),
          and Standard Deviation. The number of measurements made so far is also included. Note that
          long record lengths are NOT needed for this application, because the measurements are made
          from the trigger hardware, not from the acquired waveform. A Reference value may be taken
          by command or entered manually. When the Reference is non-zero, the measured value and the
          derived statistics are shown or queried as delta values from the Reference. The A-B
          Trigger Time Interval Application also uses trigger hardware to measure the time between
          the A-Event and the B-Event in an A-B Sequence trigger. The A- and B-Events may be any
          combination of trigger types: Edge, Glitch, Width, etc. A Reference value may be taken by
          command or entered manually. When the Reference value is non-zero, the measured value is
          displayed or queried as a delta from this Reference. For example, if the ``COUnter:TYPe``
          parameter is set to FREQuency, the ``COUnter:STAte ON`` command causes the display of the
          frequency of the triggered channel signal, which is assumed to be an infinitely repeating
          clock. Along with the frequency value, the minimum, maximum, average (mean), and standard
          deviation of the frequency are also displayed. Finally, a reference value is displayed.
          The reference is 0.0 by default, but may be captured as the last measured value at any
          time using the COUnter REF command. When the reference value is nonzero, the other values
          are deltas from the reference value. The displayed information is typical of products
          generally referred to by the industry as 'requency Counters. At the user's discretion, the
          ``COUnter:VIEW`` <PERiod | FREQuency> command can be used to view the information as the
          Frequency (Hz) or Period (seconds). The default view is Frequency. As a second example, if
          the ``COUnter:TYPe`` parameter is set to TIME, the ``COUnter:STAte ON`` command causes the
          display of the Time interval from the Trigger A-Event to the Trigger B-Event. These events
          can be from any trigger types in an A->B Trigger Sequence. In this case only the Time and
          the Reference value are displayed. The COUnter REF command takes the Reference value as
          before, but in this case the units relate to Time (seconds). DPO70000SX Series only. This
          command is optional.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``COUnter:STAte?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``COUnter:STAte?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``COUnter:STAte value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - COUnter:STAte {<NR1>|OFF|ON}
        - COUnter:STAte?

    **Info:**
        - ``<NR1>`` , if 0 disables the counter function, if 1 enables the counter function.
        - ``OFF`` disables the counter function. The default value is OFF.
        - ``ON`` enables the counter function.

    def state(self) -> CounterState:
        """Return the ``COUnter:STAte`` command.

        **Description:**
            - Enables the Trigger Source Frequency or A-B Trigger Time Interval application,
              depending on the value of the ``COUnter:TYPe`` parameter. This command sets or queries
              the Counter State enumerated value (OFF/ON) used to enable/disable the display of
              frequency or time information in the graticule area or in the Results Table. The
              Trigger Source Frequency Application uses trigger hardware, rather than the acquired
              waveform, to measure the frequency of the signal on the trigger source to a very high
              precision. Best results are obtained when the External Reference is tied between the
              instrument and the source of the trigger signal. As a result of using the trigger
              hardware, the measurement update rate is very fast, 1/3 second by default. An A-Event
              Edge to B-Event Edge A->B Sequence must be used. Statistics are derived from the
              measured values: Minimum, Maximum, Average (mean), and Standard Deviation. The number
              of measurements made so far is also included. Note that long record lengths are NOT
              needed for this application, because the measurements are made from the trigger
              hardware, not from the acquired waveform. A Reference value may be taken by command or
              entered manually. When the Reference is non-zero, the measured value and the derived
              statistics are shown or queried as delta values from the Reference. The A-B Trigger
              Time Interval Application also uses trigger hardware to measure the time between the
              A-Event and the B-Event in an A-B Sequence trigger. The A- and B-Events may be any
              combination of trigger types: Edge, Glitch, Width, etc. A Reference value may be taken
              by command or entered manually. When the Reference value is non-zero, the measured
              value is displayed or queried as a delta from this Reference. For example, if the
              ``COUnter:TYPe`` parameter is set to FREQuency, the ``COUnter:STAte ON`` command
              causes the display of the frequency of the triggered channel signal, which is assumed
              to be an infinitely repeating clock. Along with the frequency value, the minimum,
              maximum, average (mean), and standard deviation of the frequency are also displayed.
              Finally, a reference value is displayed. The reference is 0.0 by default, but may be
              captured as the last measured value at any time using the COUnter REF command. When
              the reference value is nonzero, the other values are deltas from the reference value.
              The displayed information is typical of products generally referred to by the industry
              as 'requency Counters. At the user's discretion, the ``COUnter:VIEW`` <PERiod |
              FREQuency> command can be used to view the information as the Frequency (Hz) or Period
              (seconds). The default view is Frequency. As a second example, if the ``COUnter:TYPe``
              parameter is set to TIME, the ``COUnter:STAte ON`` command causes the display of the
              Time interval from the Trigger A-Event to the Trigger B-Event. These events can be
              from any trigger types in an A->B Trigger Sequence. In this case only the Time and the
              Reference value are displayed. The COUnter REF command takes the Reference value as
              before, but in this case the units relate to Time (seconds). DPO70000SX Series only.
