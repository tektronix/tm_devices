class LinktrainingTriggeron(SCPICmdWrite):
    r"""The ``LINKTRaining:TRIGgeron`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This DPO70000SX command sets or queries the TriggerOn setting of the Link Training
          application. The default argument value is ``ALL_FRAMES``, which attempts to trigger the
          scope whenever any Frame Control Channel contains new (changed) data values to capture
          FastFrame record waveforms. When the TriggerOn argument is ``FIRST_FRAME`` or
          ``LAST_FRAME``, a single record waveform is captured, and the user may select the record
          length and horizontal position, among other settings, for this waveform. When the
          TriggerOn argument is ``ALL_FRAMES``, FastFrame records are captured containing the
          decoded and marked Control Channel information. The user may select the FastFrame Length
          and maximum number of Frames (< 512 at this writing). Note that the Results Table captures
          all of the Control Channel data on both scope channels of a given lane, no matter what the
          TriggerOn argument value is chosen, because the data is captured by hardware in real-time
          ('100% live'). This means that the data in the Results Table is derived directly from the
          signal, not from the digitized waveform (that would be decoding, and we do that where
          possible). However, only some of the Control Channel values in the Results Table will be
          backed with Waveforms on the display, because the Frames may arrive faster than the
          Acquisition System can capture and store the FastFrame waveforms, or because the Link
          Training process takes more time, up to 500ms, than can be captured in a single long
          record at any reasonable sample rate. When rows in the Results Table are not backed by an
          acquired waveform on the display, three asterisks (\*\*\*) are shown in the Frame column.
          Remember, all of the Control Channel data is captured in the Results Table for all three
          Triggeron settings. So, you should rely on the data in the Results Table, using the
          waveform decoding as confirmation. Don't forget that you can use cursor-gated DPOJET
          measurements to analyze the marked waveforms that are captured. The cursor positioning is
          made easier if you set the Link Training Marks to be TRAining to delineate the PRBS
          Training Data section of the Frames. Then you can use the extents of the MARK to better
          position the cursors for the measurements. Link Training is only available on the
          DPO70000SX family of oscilloscopes.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``LINKTRaining:TRIGgeron value`` command.

class LinktrainingState(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``LINKTRaining:STAte`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This DPO70000SX command sets or queries the state of the Link Training application on the
          DPO70000SX family of oscilloscopes. The default argument value is OFF. To use the Link
          Training application, the State argument must first be set to ON. At a minimum, to capture
          the Link Training data into a Results Table, the ``LINKTRaining:ARMscope ON`` command also
          must be issued after the Link Training State is ON. Once the State is ON and the ARMscope
          is ON, the Link Training Results Table data will be captured when Link Training is
          initiated on the DUT. Initiating Link Training on the DUT is a DUT-dependent operation
          that is usually accomplished by a (serial or other bus) command to the DUT to power-up the
          Lane under test. Sometimes, it can be as simple as un-plugging and re-plugging the signal
          connector for the lane. To summarize, the minimum sequence of events to capture 100G
          Ethernet KR4 from Default Setup is ``:LINKTRaining:STATE ON``

class LinktrainingLane(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``LINKTRaining:LANE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the activation of the individual communications lanes under
          test. The defaults are Lane1 ON, and Lane2 OFF. It is taken as given that Lane1 uses
          oscilloscope Ch1 and Ch3, Lane2 uses oscilloscope Ch2 and Ch4 (to maximize sample rate).
          ATI DPO70000SX oscilloscopes only support Lane1 (on Ch1 and Ch3). <X> is the lane number
          and can be 1 or 2. One or two lanes may be tested on a single 4-channel DPO70000SX
          oscilloscope. To test up to 4 lanes simultaneously, two oscilloscopes running in
          Standalone mode may be used. This is necessary because the Time-Sync Standalone mode does
          not support independent triggering by multiple oscilloscopes. The associated Link Training
          Arm PI command or UI button, may be used to arm each oscilloscope individually. When the
          Link Training signal is generated by the devices under test, the individual oscilloscopes
          will each trigger, capturing the waveforms on their respective displays and the protocol
          information in their respective Results Tables. Note that each Lane requires two
          oscilloscope channels, because the lanes are bi-directional (Full Duplex). Link Training

class LinktrainingEqualizationchItem(ValidatedDynamicNumberCmd, SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``LINKTRaining:EQUalizationCH<x>`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This 70KSX command sets the equalization value for Link Training of the specified channel.
          The default setting is zero. The units are dB. If you are probing a signal near to the
          transmitter, you likely do not need to increase the equalization value. However, if you
          are probing on a backplane, or other situation where the signal is seriously attenuated,
          you may want to increase the equalization value. Note that this equalization only applies
          to the trigger path in the oscilloscope. It does not apply to the data path. Use the SDLA
          option to provide equalization/de-embedding on the data path. Increasing the trigger path
          equalization value will improve the protocol data recovered into the Link Training Results
          Table when you are probing a seriously attenuated signal. Use the SDLA option to improve
          the equalization of the data path waveforms displayed on the oscilloscope. Since the
          protocol data (Ethernet Control Channel Coefficient Updates and Status Responses) is
          transmitted at ¼ the nominal bit rate (25 Gb/s for 100G Ethernet), the equalization value
          should be set considering ½ that reduced bitrate. For example, for 100G Ethernet, the
          protocol data is transmitted at 6.25 Gb/s, so set the equalization value considering half
          of that rate, 3.125 Gb/s. The Link Training application is only available on the 70KSX

            - This 70KSX command sets the maximum Acquire Time for Link Training from 1 to 10
              seconds. The default value is 2 seconds. The link training process is defined by the
              IEEE to complete within 500 ms. So, the default 2 seconds is sufficient for most
              purposes. However, some devices can be put into a mode where the Link Training process
              is repeated continuously. In this special case you may want to increase the acquire
              time. Increasing the acquire time will capture more rows of protocol data into the
              Link Training Results Table. Naturally, you will have to wait a little longer for the
              acquisition to complete. The Link Training application is only available on the 70KSX
              oscilloscopes.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``LINKTRaining:ACQTime?`` query.

              ('power-up' the lane), the Control Channel data and digitized waveforms are captured

              connector for the lane. Note that it is not necessary to set the ARMscope to OFF as
              this is done automatically by the system. To summarize, the minimum sequence of events

              rate (25 Gb/s for 100G Ethernet), the equalization value should be set considering ½

              When rows in the Results Table are not backed by an acquired waveform on the display,
              three asterisks (\*\*\*) are shown in the Frame column. Remember, all of the Control
              Channel data is captured in the Results Table for all three Triggeron settings. So,
              you should rely on the data in the Results Table, using the waveform decoding as
              confirmation. Don't forget that you can use cursor-gated DPOJET measurements to
              analyze the marked waveforms that are captured. The cursor positioning is made easier
              if you set the Link Training Marks to be TRAining to delineate the PRBS Training Data
              section of the Frames. Then you can use the extents of the MARK to better position the
              cursors for the measurements. Link Training is only available on the DPO70000SX family
              of oscilloscopes.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``LINKTRaining:TRIGgeron value``
              command.

        **SCPI Syntax:**

        ::

            - LINKTRaining:TRIGgeron <FIRst_frame | LASt_frame | ALL_frames>

        **Info:**
            - ``FIRst_frame`` sets Link Training TRIGgeron to ``FIRst_frame``.
            - ``LASt_frame`` sets Link Training TRIGgeron to ``LASt_frame``.
            - ``ALL_frames`` sets Link Training TRIGgeron to ``ALL_frames``.
