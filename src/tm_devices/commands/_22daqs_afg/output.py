    """The ``OUTPut:TRIGger:MODE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the mode (trigger or sync) for Trigger Output signal. When
          the burst count is set to Inf-Cycles in burst mode, TRIGger indicates that the infinite
          number of cycles of waveform will be output from the Trigger Output connector. When the
          burst count is set to Inf-Cycles in burst mode, SYNC indicates that one pulse waveform is
          output from the Trigger Output connector when the Inf-Cycles starts. When Run Mode is
          specified other than Burst Inf-Cycles, TRIGger and SYNC have the same effect.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``OUTPut:TRIGger:MODE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``OUTPut:TRIGger:MODE?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``OUTPut:TRIGger:MODE value`` command.
