    **Description:**
        - This command sets or query whether to enable the arbitrary function generator output for
          the specified channel.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``OUTPut1:STATe?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``OUTPut1:STATe?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``OUTPut1:STATe value`` command.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``OUTPut1:POLarity?`` query.

    **Description:**
        - The ``OUTPut:IMPedance`` command sets the output load impedance for the specified channel.
          The specified value is used for amplitude, offset, and high/low level settings. You can
          set the impedance to any value from 1 Ω to 10 kΩ with a resolution of 1 Ω or 3 digits. The
          default value is 50 Ω . The ``OUTPut:IMPedance?`` command returns the current load
          impedance setting in ohms. If the load impedance is set to INFinity, the query command
          returns '9.9E+37'.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``OUTPut1:IMPedance?`` query.
