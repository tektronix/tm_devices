    """The ``USBDevice:CONFigure`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command may be used to configure the rear USB port to be off or enabled as a USBTMC
          device. Users should be cautious using this command via the USBTMC interface as a change
          to the configuration of this interface from a USBTMC device will cause USBTMC
          communication to cease. It is intended to be used via the Ethernet interface to control
          the USB device interface.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``USBDevice:CONFigure?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``USBDevice:CONFigure?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``USBDevice:CONFigure value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - USBDevice:CONFigure {DISabled|USBTmc}
        - USBDevice:CONFigure?

    **Info:**
        - ``DISabled`` will disable the rear USB port.
        - ``USBTmc`` enables the rear USB port.
