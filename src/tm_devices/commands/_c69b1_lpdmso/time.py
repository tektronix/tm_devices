    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the time zone using the difference between the desired time
          zone and UTC.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``TIMe:ZONe:UTCDELTa?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``TIMe:ZONe:UTCDELTa?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``TIMe:ZONe:UTCDELTa value`` command.
