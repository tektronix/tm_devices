class AcquireStopafter(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``ACQuire:STOPAfter`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries whether the instrument continually acquires acquisitions or
          acquires a single sequence. Pressing SINGLE on the front panel button is equivalent to
          sending these commands: ``ACQUIRE:STOPAFTER SEQUENCE`` and ``ACQUIRE:STATE 1``.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - ACQuire:STOPAfter {RUNSTop|SEQuence}
        - ACQuire:STOPAfter?

    **Info:**
        - ``RUNSTop`` specifies that the instrument will continually acquire data, if
          ``ACQuire:STATE`` is turned on.
        - ``SEQuence`` specifies that the next acquisition will be a single-sequence acquisition.
    """


class AcquireState(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``ACQuire:STATE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command starts or stops acquisitions. When state is set to ON or RUN, a new
          acquisition will be started. If the last acquisition was a single acquisition sequence, a
          new single sequence acquisition will be started. If the last acquisition was continuous, a
          new continuous acquisition will be started. If RUN is issued in the middle of completing a
          single sequence acquisition (for example, averaging or enveloping), the acquisition
          sequence is restarted, and any accumulated data is discarded. Also, the instrument resets
          the number of acquisitions. If the RUN argument is issued while in continuous mode, a
          reset occurs and acquired data continues to acquire. If ``acquire:stopafter`` is SEQUENCE,
          this command leaves the instrument in single sequence, unlike the run/stop button which
          takes the instrument out of single sequence.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STATE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STATE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STATE value`` command.

    **Info:**
        - ``SAMple`` specifies that the displayed data point value is the first sampled value that
          is taken during the acquisition interval. The CURVE query, depending on sample rate, will
          result in either 8 bit or 16 bit data. In case of 8 bit data, the precision is also 8 bit.
          However, in case of 16 bit data, 12 bit precision data is zero padded in lower 4 bits.
          SAMple is the default mode.
        - ``PEAKdetect`` specifies the display of high-low range of the samples taken from a single
          waveform acquisition. The high-low range is displayed as a vertical column that extends
          from the highest to the lowest value sampled during the acquisition interval. PEAKdetect
          mode can reveal the presence of aliasing or narrow spikes.
        - ``HIRes`` specifies Hi Res mode where the displayed data point value is the average of all
          the samples taken during the acquisition interval. This is a form of averaging, where the
          average comes from a single waveform acquisition. The number of samples taken during the
          acquisition interval determines the number of data values that compose the average.
        - ``AVErage`` specifies averaging mode, in which the resulting waveform shows an average of
          SAMple data points from several separate waveform acquisitions. The instrument processes
          the number of waveforms you specify into the acquired waveform, creating a running
          exponential average of the input signal. The number of waveform acquisitions that go into
          making up the average waveform is set or queried using the ``ACQUIRE:NUMAVG`` command.
        - ``ENVelope`` specifies envelope mode, where the resulting waveform displays the range of
          PEAKdetect from continued waveform acquisitions.

        **Info:**
            - ``SAMple`` specifies that the displayed data point value is the first sampled value
              that is taken during the acquisition interval. The CURVE query, depending on sample
              rate, will result in either 8 bit or 16 bit data. In case of 8 bit data, the precision
              is also 8 bit. However, in case of 16 bit data, 12 bit precision data is zero padded
              in lower 4 bits. SAMple is the default mode.
            - ``PEAKdetect`` specifies the display of high-low range of the samples taken from a
              single waveform acquisition. The high-low range is displayed as a vertical column that
              extends from the highest to the lowest value sampled during the acquisition interval.
              PEAKdetect mode can reveal the presence of aliasing or narrow spikes.
            - ``HIRes`` specifies Hi Res mode where the displayed data point value is the average of
              all the samples taken during the acquisition interval. This is a form of averaging,
              where the average comes from a single waveform acquisition. The number of samples
              taken during the acquisition interval determines the number of data values that
              compose the average.
            - ``AVErage`` specifies averaging mode, in which the resulting waveform shows an average
              of SAMple data points from several separate waveform acquisitions. The instrument
              processes the number of waveforms you specify into the acquired waveform, creating a
              running exponential average of the input signal. The number of waveform acquisitions
              that go into making up the average waveform is set or queried using the
              ``ACQUIRE:NUMAVG`` command.
            - ``ENVelope`` specifies envelope mode, where the resulting waveform displays the range
              of PEAKdetect from continued waveform acquisitions.

            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter?`` query.
            - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter?`` query and
              raise an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
            - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``ACQuire:STOPAfter value`` command.

        **SCPI Syntax:**

        ::

            - ACQuire:STOPAfter {RUNSTop|SEQuence}
            - ACQuire:STOPAfter?

        **Info:**
            - ``RUNSTop`` specifies that the instrument will continually acquire data, if
              ``ACQuire:STATE`` is turned on.
            - ``SEQuence`` specifies that the next acquisition will be a single-sequence
              acquisition.
