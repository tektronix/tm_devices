    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the source at the Auxiliary Output BNC connection.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``AUXout:SOUrce?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``AUXout:SOUrce?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``AUXout:SOUrce value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - AUXout:SOUrce {ATRIGger|REFOUT|AFG}
        - AUXout:SOUrce?

    **Info:**
        - ``ATRIGger`` sets the source at the BNC connector to the main trigger.
        - ``REFOUT`` sets the source at the BNC connector to the reference output.
        - ``AFG`` sets the source at the BNC connector to the AFG output.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``AUXout:EDGE?`` query.
