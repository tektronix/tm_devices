class PiloggerState(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``PILOGger:STATE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the state of the programmatic interface command log. If the
          location specified by ``PILOGGER:FILENAME`` does not exist or is not writable, attempts to
          turn the PI command logger ON will fail, and the state will be set to 0 (OFF).

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``PILOGger:STATE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``PILOGger:STATE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``PILOGger:STATE value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - PILOGger:STATE {<NR1>|OFF|ON}
        - PILOGger:STATE?

    **Info:**
        - ``<NR1>`` = 0 disables the PI command logger; any other value turns the PI command logger
          on.
        - ``OFF`` disables the PI command logger.
        - ``ON`` enables the PI command logger.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the location where the programmatic interface command log
          will be saved.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``PILOGger:FILEName?`` query.

          save the command log, in the format '[<path>]<filename.ext>'. Specifying a path is
          optional. If no path is entered, the instrument will search in the current working
