    """The ``SELect:CH<x>`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Turns the display of the channel <x> waveform on or off, where <x > is the channel number.
          This command also resets the acquisition. The query returns whether the channel is on or
          off but does not indicate whether it is the specified waveform.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``SELect:CH<x>?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``SELect:CH<x>?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``SELect:CH<x> value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - SELect:CH<x> {ON|OFF|1|0}
        - SELect:CH<x>?

    **Info:**
        - ``ON`` turns on the display of the specified waveform. This waveform also becomes the
          selected waveform.
        - ``OFF`` turns off the display of the specified waveform.
        - ``1`` turns on the display of the specified waveform. This waveform also becomes the
          selected waveform.
        - ``0`` turns off the display of the specified waveform.
