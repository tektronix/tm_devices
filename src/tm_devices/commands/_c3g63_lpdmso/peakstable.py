    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the Frequency Resolution state for peak markers table.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``PEAKSTABle:TABle<x>:FRESolution?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``PEAKSTABle:TABle<x>:FRESolution?``
