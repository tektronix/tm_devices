    """The ``AUXout:SOUrce`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the trigger source at the BNC connection. This command is
          equivalent to selecting External Signals from the Utilities menu and then selecting the
          desired Configuration setting.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``AUXout:SOUrce?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``AUXout:SOUrce?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``AUXout:SOUrce value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - AUXout:SOUrce {ATRIGger|BTRIGger|DELayed|EVENT|REFOUT}
        - AUXout:SOUrce?

    **Info:**
        - ``ATRIGger`` sets the source at the BNC connector to the main trigger.
        - ``BTRIGger`` sets the source at the BNC connector to the delayed trigger. (7K/70K).
        - ``EVENT`` sets the source at the BNC connector to a specified event. (7K/70K).
        - ``DELayed`` sets the source at the BNC connector to the delayed trigger.
        - ``REFOUT`` sets the source at the BNC connector to the reference output. (5K/7K).

class AuxoutEdge(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``AUXout:EDGE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the direction in which the Auxiliary Output signal will
          transition when a trigger occurs.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``AUXout:EDGE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``AUXout:EDGE?`` query and raise an

    **Info:**
        - ``RISing`` sets the polarity to the rising edge.
