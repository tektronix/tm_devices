    """The ``CURVENext`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This query-only command returns unique waveform data from the instrument. This query
          performs just like CURVE?, except multiple uses guarantee that the waveform returned is
          always a new acquisition since the previous CURVENEXT. Note that if the instrument is
          acquiring waveform records at a slow rate (high resolution mode), you must configure the
          controller for long timeout thresholds. Data will not be transferred until a new waveform
          is acquired since the previous ``:CURVENext?`` response.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``CURVENext?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``CURVENext?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
