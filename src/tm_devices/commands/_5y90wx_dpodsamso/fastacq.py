    """The ``FASTAcq:STATE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the state of Fast Acquisitions. This command is equivalent to
          the FASTACQ button on the front panel.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``FASTAcq:STATE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``FASTAcq:STATE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``FASTAcq:STATE value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - FASTAcq:STATE {<NR1>|ON|OFF}
        - FASTAcq:STATE?

    **Info:**
        - ``<NR1>`` = 0 disables Fast Acquisitions mode; any other value enables Fast Acquisitions
          mode.
        - ``ON`` enables Fast Acquisitions mode.

          acquisitions.
