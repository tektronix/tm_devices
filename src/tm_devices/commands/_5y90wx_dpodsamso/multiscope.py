    **Description:**
        - This query returns the current state of oscilloscopes in the MultiScope system.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MULTiscope:STATUS?`` query.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write()`` method will send the ``MULTiscope:RESTART`` command.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write()`` method will send the ``MULTiscope:EXIT`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the current MultiScope operational configuration. This

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``MULTiscope:CONFig value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

        - MULTiscope:CONFig {ATI | TEKCONnect | TIMESYnc}

    **Info:**
        - ``ATI`` sets the MultiScope system to use the ATI channels.
        - ``TEKCONNECT`` sets the MultiScope system to use the TekConnect channels.
        - ``TIMESYNC`` sets the MultiScope system to use the TekConnect channels in TimeSync mode.
          TimeSync mode is only available on some instruments. The Master instrument controls the
          instrument hardware such as the horizontal and trigger settings. Desired results are only
          achieved in Single Sequence acquisition mode. Data from all channels can be acquired using
          programmable interface commands.
