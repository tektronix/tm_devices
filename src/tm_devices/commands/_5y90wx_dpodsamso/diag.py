        - This command determines or queries whether the next execution of diagnostics looping will

          set of diagnostic functions. This command is equivalent to selecting Instrument

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``DIAg:CONTROL:HALT?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``DIAg:CONTROL:HALT?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``DIAg:CONTROL:HALT value`` command.
