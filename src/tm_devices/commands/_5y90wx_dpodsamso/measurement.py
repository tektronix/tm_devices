          above or below the mid point, depending on whether the high reference point or the low
          reference point is being defined. Because the statistical approach ignores short-term

          examining pulses.
        - ``MEAN`` sets the high and low reference levels to the mean values using all values either
          above or below the midpoint, depending on whether it is defining the high or low reference

          reference waveform) between two waveforms. The measurement is made between the middle
          reference points of the two waveforms and is expressed in degrees, where 360Â° represents
          one waveform cycle.
        - ``PK2Pk`` (peak-to-peak) finds the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum
          amplitude in the entire waveform or gated region. When histogram is selected with the

          diagram, which indicates the vertical eye opening relative to the noise at the low and
          high logic levels. It is the ratio of the eye size to noise.
        - ``RISe`` timing measurement finds the rise time of the waveform. The rise time is the time
          it takes for the leading edge of the first pulse encountered to rise from a low reference
          value (default is 10%) to a high reference value (default is 90%).

              region.
            - ``Amplitude = High - Low``
            - ``AREa`` measures the voltage over time. The area is over the entire waveform or gated
              region and is measured in volt-seconds. The area measured above the ground is
              positive, while the area below ground is negative.
            - ``BURst`` measures the duration of a burst. The measurement is made over the entire
              waveform or gated region.
            - ``CARea`` (cycle area) measures the voltage over time. In other words, it measures in
              volt-seconds, the area over the first cycle in the waveform or the first cycle in the
              gated region. The area measured above the common reference point is positive, while
              the area below the common reference point is negative.
            - ``CMEan`` (cycle mean) measures the arithmetic mean over the first cycle in the
              waveform or the first cycle in the gated region.
            - ``CRMs`` (cycle rms) measures the true Root Mean Square voltage over the first cycle
              in the waveform or the first cycle in the gated region.

              point of the source waveform and the destination waveform.
            - ``DISTDUty`` (duty cycle distortion) measures the time between the falling edge and
              the rising edge of the eye pattern at the mid reference level. It is the peak-to-peak
              time variation of the first eye crossing measured at the mid-reference as a percent of
              the eye period.
            - ``EXTINCTDB`` measures the extinction ratio of an optical waveform (eye diagram).
              Extinction Ratio (dB) measures the ratio of the average power levels for the logic
              High to the logic Low of an optical waveform and expresses the result in dB. This
              measurement only works for fast acquisition signals or a reference waveform saved in
              fast acquisition mode.
            - ``Extinction dB = 10 Ã (log 10 (High / Low)``
            - ``EXTINCTPCT`` measures the extinction ratio of the selected optical waveform.
              Extinction Ratio (%) measures the ratio of the average power levels for the logic Low
              (off) to the logic (High) (on) of an optical waveform and expresses the result in
              percent. This measurement only works for fast acquisition signals or a reference
              waveform saved in fast acquisition mode.
            - ``Extinction % = 100.0 Ã (Low / High)``
            - ``EXTINCTRATIO`` measures the extinction ratio of the selected optical waveform.
              Extinction Ratio measures the ratio of the average power levels for the logic High to
              the logic Low of an optical waveform and expresses the result without units. This
              measurement only works for fast acquisition signals or a reference waveform saved in
              fast acquisition mode. Extinction ratios greater than 100 or less than 1 generate
              errors; low must be greater than or equal to 1 ÂµW.
            - ``Extinction Ratio = (High / Low)``
            - ``EYEHeight`` measures the vertical opening of an eye diagram in volts.
            - ``EYEWidth`` measures the width of an eye diagram in seconds.
            - ``FALL`` measures the time taken for the falling edge of the first pulse in the
              waveform or gated region to fall from a high reference value (default is 90%) to a low
              reference value (default is 10%).
            - ``FREQuency`` measures the first cycle in the waveform or gated region. Frequency is
              the reciprocal of the period and is measured in hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 cycle per
              second.
            - ``HIGH`` measures the High reference (100% level, sometimes called Topline) of a
              waveform.
            - ``HITs`` (histogram hits) measures the number of points in or on the histogram box.
            - ``LOW`` measures the Low reference (0% level, sometimes called Baseline) of a
              waveform.
            - ``MAXimum`` finds the maximum amplitude. This value is the most positive peak voltage
              found. It is measured over the entire waveform or gated region. When histogram is
              selected with the ``MEASUREMENT:METHOD`` command, the maximum measurement measures the
              voltage of the highest nonzero bin in vertical histograms or the time of the
              right-most bin in horizontal histograms.
            - ``MEAN`` amplitude measurement finds the arithmetic mean over the entire waveform or
              gated region. When histogram is selected with the ``MEASUREMENT:METHOD`` command, the
              mean measurement measures the average of all acquired points within or on the
              histogram.
            - ``MEDian`` (histogram measurement) measures the middle point of the histogram box.
              Half of all acquired points within or on the histogram box are less than this value
              and half are greater than this value.
            - ``MINImum`` finds the minimum amplitude. This value is typically the most negative
              peak voltage. It is measured over the entire waveform or gated region. When histogram
              is selected with the ``MEASUREMENT:METHOD`` command, the minimum measurement measures
              the lowest nonzero bin in vertical histograms or the time of the left-most nonzero bin
              in the horizontal histograms.
            - ``NCROss`` (timing measurement) measures the time from the trigger point to the first
              falling edge of the waveform or gated region. The distance (time) is measured at the

          equivalent to selecting Gating from the Measure menu and then clicking the desired
          Measurement Gating setting.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MEASUrement:GATing?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``MEASUrement:GATing?`` query and raise
          an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``MEASUrement:GATing value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - MEASUrement:GATing {ON|OFF|<NR1>|ZOOM<x>|CURSor}
        - MEASUrement:GATing?

    **Info:**
        - ``ON`` turns on measurement gating.
        - ``OFF`` turns off measurement gating.
        - ``<NR1>`` = 0 turns off measurement gating; any other value turns on measurement gating.
        - ``ZOOM<x>`` turns on gating, using the left and right edges of the zoom box. <x> specifies
          the zoom window, which ranges from 1 through 4.
        - ``CURSOR`` limits measurements to the portion of the waveform between the vertical bar
          cursors, even if they are off screen.
