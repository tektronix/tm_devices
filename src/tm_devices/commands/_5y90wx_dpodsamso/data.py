    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the last data point that will be transferred when using the

          for the transfer of partial waveforms to the controller. If <NR1> is greater than the

          ``DATa:STOP`` is less than ``DATa:STARt``, the values will be swapped internally for the
          CURVE? query. If you always want to transfer complete waveforms, set ``DATa:STARt`` to 1
          and ``DATa:STOP`` to the maximum record length, or larger. Changes to the record length
          value are not automatically reflected in the ``DATa:STOP`` value. As record length is

          increases in record length if the distance from ``DATa:STARt`` to ``DATa:STOP`` stays
