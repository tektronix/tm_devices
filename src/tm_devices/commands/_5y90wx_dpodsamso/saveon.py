    **Description:**
        - Sets or queries whether to save a waveform when a trigger occurs when ``SAVEON:TRIGGER``
          is ON. The waveform will be saved to the file you selected with ``SAVEON:FILE:NAME``, in
          the location that you selected using ``SAVEON:FILE:DEST``. You can set options for file
          storage (such as file name, file destination, and autoincrement), using the
          ``SAVEON:FILE`` commands.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``SAVEON:WAVEform?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``SAVEON:WAVEform?`` query and raise an

          using Trigger commands or the instrument user interface. This command is longer necessary.
          Please see Act On Event commands for future development. The trigger will cause the
          instrument to save an image or a waveform to a file, depending on what you specified. For
          example, if you have set ``SAVEON:IMAGE`` to On, and a trigger event occurs, the

          Follow standard Microsoft Windows naming conventions. The limit is 127 characters, with no
          spaces allowed in the name. File storage location The file is saved in the location
          specified by the ``SAVEON:FILE:DEST`` command. Default names The default file name is
          SaveOnEvent. This name will be appended under certain circumstances. If you have
          previously selected (through the oscilloscope interface) to save channel 1 and channel 2
          waveforms, for example, two files are saved, and the default file names will reflect the
          channel. If you have selected to save bus B1, the default file name will reflect that. The
          file name also indicates whether it is an image, measurement, or waveform. Autoincrement
          If ``SAVEON:FILE:AUTOInc`` is enabled, a number will be added to the file name and will be
          incremented for each new file. For example, if three events trigger the oscilloscope to
          save a measurement, three files will be created, which might be named 'SaveOnEvent1Meas,'
          'SaveOnEvent2Meas,' and 'SaveOnEvent3Meas.' Extensions Although these files have
          extensions (CSV for measurements and WFM for waveforms, for example), you do not need to

            - Sets or queries the file name to use when the file type is set to Custom. Selecting a
              file name You can select your own file name by entering the desired name in the
              <string>. Follow standard Microsoft Windows naming conventions. The limit is 127
              characters, with no spaces allowed in the name. File storage location The file is
              saved in the location specified by the ``SAVEON:FILE:DEST`` command. Default names The
              default file name is SaveOnEvent. This name will be appended under certain

              save channel 1 and channel 2 waveforms, for example, two files are saved, and the

              image, measurement, or waveform. Autoincrement If ``SAVEON:FILE:AUTOInc`` is enabled,
              a number will be added to the file name and will be incremented for each new file. For
