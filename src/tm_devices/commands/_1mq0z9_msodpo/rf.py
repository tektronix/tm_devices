        - This command specifies which window will be used for the windowing function, which is only
          used for the three time domain RF traces (RF Amplitude vs. Time, RF Frequency vs. Time and
          RF Phase vs. Time). The windowing function is a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique
          used to minimize the discontinuities between successive frames of an RF time domain
          signal.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``RF:WINdow?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``RF:WINdow?`` query and raise an

        - ``HANning`` - a high or moderate resolution window based on a cosine series.

          series.

    **Description:**
        - This command switches the frequency domain spectrogram display on or off. The spectrogram
          illustrates how frequency and amplitude change over time. It is useful for monitoring
          slowly-changing RF events, and for identifying low amplitude signals too subtle for the
          eye to catch in a regular frequency domain display. The x-axis shows frequency, and the
          y-axis shows time. Amplitude is represented by the color of the trace. Cold colors (blue,
          green) indicate low amplitude, and hot colors (red, yellow) indicate high amplitude. When

    **Description:**
        - This command specifies the spectrogram slice number that is to be displayed. The slice can
          only be selected or changed when acquisitions have been stopped. As soon as acquisitions
          start again, the slice number is reset to 0 (the latest slice). Attempts to select a slice
          number outside of range, or when acquisitions are running, are ignored. The query form
          returns the currently selected spectrogram slice. To use this command, first turn on the
          spectrogram (``RF:SPECTROGRAM:STATE``). Then query the number of slices
          (``RF:SPECTROGRAM:NUMSLICES``). Stop the acquisition when you've reached the number of
          desired slices. Then select the slice to display (``RF:SPECTROGRAM:SLICESELECT``). Each
          slice of the spectrogram corresponds to a single RF acquisition. The FFT samples the
          entire spectrum for the incoming signal (at the rate with which new spectrums are
          acquired). The newest spectrum is on the bottom edge of the spectrogram, and the oldest is
          on the top edge. When the oscilloscope is stopped, you can scroll 'back in time' through
          the spectrogram using the spectrum slice control. When you select a spectrogram slice, it
          is displayed in the bottom window as the RF Normal trace.

        **Description:**
            - This command specifies the spectrogram slice number that is to be displayed. The slice
              can only be selected or changed when acquisitions have been stopped. As soon as
              acquisitions start again, the slice number is reset to 0 (the latest slice). Attempts
              to select a slice number outside of range, or when acquisitions are running, are
              ignored. The query form returns the currently selected spectrogram slice. To use this
              command, first turn on the spectrogram (``RF:SPECTROGRAM:STATE``). Then query the
              number of slices (``RF:SPECTROGRAM:NUMSLICES``). Stop the acquisition when you've
              reached the number of desired slices. Then select the slice to display
              (``RF:SPECTROGRAM:SLICESELECT``). Each slice of the spectrogram corresponds to a
              single RF acquisition. The FFT samples the entire spectrum for the incoming signal (at
              the rate with which new spectrums are acquired). The newest spectrum is on the bottom
              edge of the spectrogram, and the oldest is on the top edge. When the oscilloscope is
              stopped, you can scroll 'back in time' through the spectrogram using the spectrum
              slice control. When you select a spectrogram slice, it is displayed in the bottom
              window as the RF Normal trace.

              indicate high amplitude. When acquisitions are stopped, you can navigate back through

    **Description:**
        - Sets or returns the user-selected mode for an RF pre-amp connected to the RF input -
          either BYPass or AUTO. Note that the actual status of the pre-amp (either NONE, ON or
          BYPass ) is determined by the selected mode along with the RF reference level. You can
          query the status of the pre-amp using the command ``RF:PROBE:PREAMP:STATUS``

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``RF:PRObe:PREAmp:MODe?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``RF:PRObe:PREAmp:MODe?`` query and

        - RF:PRObe:PREAmp:MODe?

    **Info:**
        - ``BYPass`` means the pre-amp will not amplify the signal. When the mode is set to BYPass,
          the pre-amp amplification is always off, regardless of the RF reference level.
        - ``AUTO`` means the pre-amp will turn its amplification on or off based on the RF reference
          level. When the MODe is set to AUTO and the RF reference level is below the RF reference
          level threshold, then the pre-amp amplification is automatically turned on, and the STATus
          is set to ON. When the RF reference level is at or above the RF reference level threshold,
          then the pre-amp amplification is automatically turned off, and the STATus is set to
          BYPass.

            - This command configures the measurement bandwidth to use for the Main channel, as well

              domain trace. The RF measurement type must first be set to ACPR using the command

              adjusts the channel spacing. If the bandwidth is adjusted to be wider than the channel
              spacing, the oscilloscope will automatically increase the channel spacing and the
              span.

            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``RF:UNIts?`` query.
            - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``RF:UNIts?`` query and raise an
              AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
            - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``RF:UNIts value`` command.

        **Info:**
            - ``DBM`` - Decibel milliwatts.

        **Description:**
            - This command specifies which window will be used for the windowing function, which is
              only used for the three time domain RF traces (RF Amplitude vs. Time, RF Frequency vs.
              Time and RF Phase vs. Time). The windowing function is a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
              technique used to minimize the discontinuities between successive frames of an RF time
              domain signal.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``RF:WINdow?`` query.
            - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``RF:WINdow?`` query and raise an

        **Info:**
            - ``RECTangular`` - window function equivalent to multiplying all gate data by one
              (sometimes known as a Dirichlet window).
            - ``HAMming`` - a high or moderate resolution window based on a cosine series.
            - ``HANning`` - a high or moderate resolution window based on a cosine series.
            - ``BLAckmanharris`` - a low-resolution (high dynamic range) window based on a cosine
              series.
            - ``KAIser`` - a high or moderate resolution window.
            - ``FLATtop`` - a low-resolution (high dynamic range) window.
