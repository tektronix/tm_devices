    """The ``TIME`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the time that the instrument displays. This command is
          equivalent to selecting Set Time & Date from the Utilities menu and then setting the
          fields in the Time group box.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``TIME?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``TIME?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``TIME value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - TIME <QString>
        - TIME?

    **Info:**
        - ``<QString>`` is a time in the form '``hh:mm:ss``' where hh refers to a two-digit hour
          number, mm refers to a two-digit minute number from 01 to 60, and ss refers to a two-digit
          second number from 01 to 60.
