            - This query returns the number of test violations that have occurred in the current

              commands for typical tasks is included in an appendix.

            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MASK:COUNt:VIOLATIONS?`` query.

            - This command controls whether a mask is displayed on the screen. This is useful for
              temporarily turning off masks without deleting them. Turning off the Mask Display when
              the Mask Test is on, turns off the Mask Test. A series of examples showing how to use
              mask commands for typical tasks is included in an appendix.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MASK:DISplay?`` query.
            - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``MASK:DISplay?`` query and raise an
              AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
            - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``MASK:DISplay value`` command.

            - ``0`` removes the mask from the display;.

        **Description:**
            - This command locks the mask to the source waveform so that any changes made to the
              horizontal and/or vertical scale settings of the waveform will redraw the mask
              segments in proportion. This feature is useful for expanding the horizontal and/or
