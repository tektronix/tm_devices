    """The ``RRB:STATE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command returns or sets the state of the Results Readout bar (RRB). Visible if set to
          1. Hidden when set to 0.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``RRB:STATE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``RRB:STATE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``RRB:STATE value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - RRB:STATE {<NR1>|OFF|ON}
        - RRB:STATE?

    **Info:**
        - ``OFF or <NR1> = 0`` sets the state of the right results readout bar to off.
        - ``ON or <NR1> ≠ 0`` sets the state of the right results readout bar to on.
