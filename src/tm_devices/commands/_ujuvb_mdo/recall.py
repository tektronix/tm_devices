class RecallWaveform(SCPICmdWrite):
    """The ``RECAll:WAVEform`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command (no query form) recalls a stored waveform to a reference memory location,
          and, for instruments with the arbitrary waveform feature, to arbitrary waveform edit
          memory (EMEM). Only the first waveform in a .CSV file is recalled for multiple waveform
          .CSV files. Recall of digital waveforms (D0 through D15) is not supported.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``RECAll:WAVEform value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - RECAll:WAVEform <Source>, <Destination>

    **Info:**
        - ``<file path>``
        - ``ARB<x>`` - x has a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4.
        - ``<QString>`` is a quoted string that specifies a location for an oscilloscope file. The
          file name and path should be input using the form <drive>:/<dir>/<filename>.<extension>.
        - ``REF<x>`` - Specifies a reference memory location to receive the saved ISF or CSV data.
          ARB1-ARB4 cannot be recalled to reference memory locations and attempting to do so on an
          instrument with the arbitrary waveform feature results in an error event. x has a minimum
          of 1 and a maximum of 4.
        - ``EMEM`` - For instruments with the arbitrary waveform feature, specifies arbitrary
          waveform edit memory (EMEM). If the source is a file, the file can be either an ISF or CSV
          file with the following restrictions.

    **Description:**
        - Restores the state of the oscilloscope from a copy of the settings stored in memory. The
          settings are stored using the ``*SAV`` command.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``RECAll:SETUp value`` command.

          location.
        - ``<file path>`` specifies a location for an oscilloscope setup file. <file path> is a
          quoted string that defines the file name and path. Input the file path using the form
          <drive>:/<dir>/<filename>.<extension> and one or <dir>s are optional. If you do not
          specify them, the oscilloscope will read the file from the default directory (see
          ``FILESYSTEM:CWD``). <filename> stands for a filename; the use of wildcard characters in
          filenames is not supported. Filename extensions are not required, but highly recommended.
