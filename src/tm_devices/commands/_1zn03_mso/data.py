class DataWidth(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``DATa:WIDth`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command specifies the width, in bytes per point, for waveform data transferred from
          the instrument via the CURVe? query. (This command is synonymous with
          ``WFMOutpre:BYT_Nr``.)

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``DATa:WIDth?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``DATa:WIDth?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``DATa:WIDth value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

        - DATa:WIDth <NR1>
        - DATa:WIDth?

    **Info:**
        - ``<NR1>`` is an integer that indicates the number of bytes per point for the outgoing
          waveform data when queried using the CURVe? command.
    """


class DataStop(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``DATa:STOP`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the last data point that will be transferred when using the
          CURVE? query. When using the CURVE command, ``DATa:STOP`` is ignored. This command allows
          for the transfer of partial waveforms to the controller. If <NR1> is greater than the
          record length, then data will be transferred up to the record length. If both
          ``DATa:STARt`` and ``DATa:STOP`` are greater than the record length, the last data point
          in the record is returned. ``DATa:STARt`` and ``DATa:STOP`` are order independent. When
          ``DATa:STOP`` is less than ``DATa:STARt``, the values will be swapped internally for the
          CURVE? query. If you always want to transfer complete waveforms, set ``DATa:STARt`` to 1
          and ``DATa:STOP`` to the maximum record length, or larger. Changes to the record length
          value are not automatically reflected in the ``DATa:STOP`` value. As record length is
          varied, the ``DATa:STOP`` value must be explicitly changed to ensure the entire record is
          transmitted. In other words, curve results will not automatically and correctly reflect
          increases in record length if the distance from ``DATa:STARt`` to ``DATa:STOP`` stays
          smaller than the increased record length.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``DATa:STOP?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``DATa:STOP?`` query and raise an

              the CURVE? query. When using the CURVE command, ``DATa:STOP`` is ignored. This command

              explicitly changed to ensure the entire record is transmitted. In other words, curve
              results will not automatically and correctly reflect increases in record length if the
