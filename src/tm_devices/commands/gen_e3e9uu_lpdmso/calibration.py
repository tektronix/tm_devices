    """The ``*CAL`` command.

    Description:
        - This query-only command starts signal path calibration (SPC) and returns the status upon
          completion. Note: When running SPC through the remote interface, calibration status cannot
          be obtained until after the SPC completes. SPC takes approximately 15 minutes per channel
          which means a total of 2 hours on an 8-channel model. Any remote command that performs an
          action on the instrument is also disabled until the SPC is complete.

    Usage:
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``*CAL?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``*CAL?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.

        ```
        - *CAL?
