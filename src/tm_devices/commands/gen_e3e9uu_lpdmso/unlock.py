    """The ``UNLock`` command.

    Description:
        - This command (no query form) unlocks the front panel controls only. To unlock the front
          panel controls and the touch screen use the LOCk NONe command. The command
          ``TOUCHSCReen:STATE ON`` enables the touch screen only. Note: If the instrument is in the
          Remote With Lockout State (RWLS), the ``UNLock`` command has no effect. For more
          information, see the ANSI-IEEE Std 488.1-1987Standard Digital Interface for Programmable
          Instrumentation, section 2.8.3 on RL State Descriptions.

    Usage:
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``UNLock value`` command.

    SCPI Syntax:
        ```
        - UNLock ALL
        ```

    Info:
        - ``ALL`` specifies that all front panel buttons and knobs are unlocked.
