    """The ``EVQty`` command.

    Description:
        - This query-only command returns the number of events that are enabled in the queue. This
          is useful when using the ALLEv? query, since it lets you know exactly how many events will
          be returned.

    Usage:
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``EVQty?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``EVQty?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.

    SCPI Syntax:
        ```
        - EVQty?
        ```
