    """The ``EVMsg`` command.

    Description:
        - This query-only command removes a single event code from the Event Queue that is
          associated with the results of the last ``*ESR?`` read and returns the event code with an
          explanatory message. For more information, see Event Handling.

    Usage:
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``EVMsg?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``EVMsg?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.

    SCPI Syntax:
        ```
        - EVMsg?
