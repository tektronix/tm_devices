    """The ``MESSage:STATE`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Controls the display of the message box.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MESSage:STATE?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``MESSage:STATE?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``MESSage:STATE value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

        - MESSage:STATE {OFF|ON|<NR1>}
        - MESSage:STATE?

    **Info:**
        - ``OFF or <NR1> = 0`` removes the message window from the screen.
        - ``ON or <NR1> â‰  0`` displays the message window and its contents on the screen.

    **Description:**
        - This command specifies the contents of the message box. ``MESSage:SHOW`` <Qstring> defines
          the content of the message box. Change in string length causes automatic resize of the
          message box to fit the text. The box may be resized using the ``MESSAGE:BOX`` command. The
          ``MESSAGE:STATE`` command is used to turn on and off the message box display.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MESSage:SHOW?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``MESSage:SHOW?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``MESSage:SHOW value`` command.

          Set.

    **Description:**
        - Clears the contents of the message box.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

class MessageBox(SCPICmdWrite, SCPICmdRead):
    """The ``MESSage:BOX`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command specifies the co-ordinates of the message box. This command does not display
          the message unless ``MESSage:STATE`` is on. X1 and Y1 are the screen coordinates of the
          top left corner of the message box. X2 and Y2 are the screen coordinates of the bottom
          right corner of the message box. All four coordinates are returned by the query. Changing
          the text in the message box, using the ``MESSAGE:SHOW`` command, automatically resizes the
          message box. If you want a custom message box size, send the ``MESSAGE:BOX`` command after
          changing the text using the ``MESSAGE:SHOW`` command. Message box settings and data are
          saved and restored in saved setups.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MESSage:BOX?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``MESSage:BOX?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``MESSage:BOX value`` command.

    **Info:**
        - ``<X1>`` and <X2> = 0 to 1023, and are pixel positions along the horizontal axis. <X1>
          defines the left and <X2> defines the right side of the window.
        - ``<Y1>`` and <Y2> = 0 to 767, and are pixel positions along the vertical axis. <Y1>
          defines the top and <Y2> defines the bottom of the window. The reserved height of all
          characters is 16 pixels so the window must be at least that high to fully display
          characters. <X2> and <Y2> are optional because the ``MESSAGE:SHOW`` command automatically
          sizes the box to fit the message. All four values are returned in a query.
