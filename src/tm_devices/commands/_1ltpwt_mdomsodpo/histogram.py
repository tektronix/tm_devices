    **Description:**
        - Returns the time (horizontal) or vertical units value (vertical) of the first bin where
          the histogram data starts. The ``HISTOGRAM:MODE`` must be either HORizontal or VERTical
          for a value to be returned. If the mode is OFF, an error event is set and nothing is

        **Info:**
            - ``HORizontal`` enables a horizontally positioned histogram that shows time
              distribution.
            - ``VERTical`` enables a vertically positioned histogram that shows a voltage
              distribution, or another distribution such as amperes.
            - ``OFF`` disables the collection of the histogram measurement.

        **Description:**
            - This command sets or queries which source will be compared against the histogram box
              when the histogram testing is enabled.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``HIStogram:SOUrce?`` query.
            - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``HIStogram:SOUrce?`` query and
              raise an AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
            - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``HIStogram:SOUrce value`` command.

        **Info:**
            - ``CH<x>`` selects the analog channel waveform to use as the source for the histogram.
              The x variable can be expressed as an integer ranging from 1 through 4. x has a
              minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4.
            - ``MATH`` selects the math waveform as the source for the histogram.
            - ``REF<1-4>`` selects a reference waveform as the source for the histogram. The x
              variable can be expressed as an integer ranging from 1 through 4.

        **Description:**
            - Returns the time (horizontal) or vertical units value (vertical) of the first bin
              where the histogram data starts. The ``HISTOGRAM:MODE`` must be either HORizontal or
              VERTical for a value to be returned. If the mode is OFF, an error event is set and
              nothing is returned. If the ``HISTOGRAM:MODE`` is HORizontal, the value returned is
              the time of the left bin. If the ``HISTOGRAM:MODE`` is VERTical the value returned is
              the vertical units value of the top bin. The returned value is an <NR3>.
