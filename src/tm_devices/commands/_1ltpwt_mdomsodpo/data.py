          the instrument via the CURVe? query. (This command is synonymous with
          ``WFMOutpre:BYT_Nr``.)

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or queries the last data point that will be transferred when using the
          CURVE? query. When using the CURVE command, ``DATa:STOP`` is ignored. This command allows
          for the transfer of partial waveforms to the controller. If <NR1> is greater than the
          record length, then data will be transferred up to the record length. If both
          ``DATa:STARt`` and ``DATa:STOP`` are greater than the record length, the last data point
          in the record is returned. ``DATa:STARt`` and ``DATa:STOP`` are order independent. When
          ``DATa:STOP`` is less than ``DATa:STARt``, the values will be swapped internally for the
          CURVE? query. If you always want to transfer complete waveforms, set ``DATa:STARt`` to 1
          and ``DATa:STOP`` to the maximum record length, or larger. Changes to the record length
          value are not automatically reflected in the ``DATa:STOP`` value. As record length is
          varied, the ``DATa:STOP`` value must be explicitly changed to ensure the entire record is

          increases in record length if the distance from ``DATa:STARt`` to ``DATa:STOP`` stays
          smaller than the increased record length.

          the byte order is swapped, meaning that the least significant byte is transferred first.

          ``WFMOutpre:BYT_Or LSB``.

              oscilloscope to the controller. x has a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4.
            - ``D<x>`` specifies which digital channel waveform data will be transferred from the
              oscilloscope to the controller. (Requires installation of option 3-MSO.) x has a
              minimum of 0 and a maximum of 15.
            - ``DIGital`` specifies that the Digital Collection waveform data will be transferred
              from the oscilloscope to the controller. (Requires installation of option 3-MSO.).

        **Description:**
            - This command sets or queries the starting data point for waveform transfer. This
              command allows for the transfer of partial waveforms to and from the instrument. Data
              will be transferred from <NR1> to ``DATa:STOP`` or the record length, whichever is
              less. If <NR1> is greater than the record length, the last data point in the record is
              transferred. ``DATa:STARt`` and ``DATa:STOP`` are order independent. When
              ``DATa:STOP`` is greater than ``DATa:STARt``, the values will be swapped internally
              for the CURVE? query.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``DATa:STARt?`` query.
            - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``DATa:STARt?`` query and raise an
              AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.

        **Description:**
            - This command sets or queries the last data point that will be transferred when using
              the CURVE? query. When using the CURVE command, ``DATa:STOP`` is ignored. This command
              allows for the transfer of partial waveforms to the controller. If <NR1> is greater
              than the record length, then data will be transferred up to the record length. If both
              ``DATa:STARt`` and ``DATa:STOP`` are greater than the record length, the last data
              point in the record is returned. ``DATa:STARt`` and ``DATa:STOP`` are order
              independent. When ``DATa:STOP`` is less than ``DATa:STARt``, the values will be
              swapped internally for the CURVE? query. If you always want to transfer complete
              waveforms, set ``DATa:STARt`` to 1 and ``DATa:STOP`` to the maximum record length, or
              larger. Changes to the record length value are not automatically reflected in the
              ``DATa:STOP`` value. As record length is varied, the ``DATa:STOP`` value must be
              explicitly changed to ensure the entire record is transmitted. In other words, curve
              results will not automatically and correctly reflect increases in record length if the
              distance from ``DATa:STARt`` to ``DATa:STOP`` stays smaller than the increased record
              length.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``DATa:STOP?`` query.
