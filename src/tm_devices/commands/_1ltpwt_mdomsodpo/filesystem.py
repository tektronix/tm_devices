        **Description:**
            - This command specifies the current working directory (CWD) for FILESystem commands.
              The default working directory is 'E:/'. Anytime you use this command to change the
              directory, the directory that you specify is retained as the current working directory
              until you either change the directory or you delete the directory. If you delete the

              default directory the next time the oscilloscope is powered on or the next time you
              execute a file system command. This command supports the permutations of file and
              directory names supported by Microsoft Windows: Relative path names; for example,
              './Temp' Absolute path names; for example, 'E:/MyWaveform' Implied relative path
              names; for example 'newfile.txt' becomes 'E:/TekScope/newfile.txt' if the current
              working directory is 'E:/TekScope'
