    """The ``MARKER:TYPe`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command specifies the marker type (either DELTa or ABSolute). An absolute marker
          shows the frequency and amplitude at the location of the marker. A delta marker shows the
          frequency and amplitude of the marker relative to the Reference Marker. The Reference
          Marker shows the absolute frequency and amplitude, regardless of this command. The marker
          amplitude measurements are in dBm for absolute, or in dBc (dB below carrier amplitude) for
          delta.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MARKER:TYPe?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``MARKER:TYPe?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.

    **Info:**
        - ``DELTa`` specifies to display the frequency and amplitude of the markers relative to the
          Reference Marker. The relative amplitude is in dBc (dB below carrier amplitude); the
          relative frequency is in Hz.
        - ``ABSolute`` specifies to display the actual frequency and amplitude of each marker. The

        **Description:**
            - This command specifies the marker type (either DELTa or ABSolute). An absolute marker
              shows the frequency and amplitude at the location of the marker. A delta marker shows
              the frequency and amplitude of the marker relative to the Reference Marker. The
              Reference Marker shows the absolute frequency and amplitude, regardless of this
              command. The marker amplitude measurements are in dBm for absolute, or in dBc (dB
              below carrier amplitude) for delta.

        **Usage:**
            - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``MARKER:TYPe?`` query.
            - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``MARKER:TYPe?`` query and raise an
              AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
            - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``MARKER:TYPe value`` command.

        **SCPI Syntax:**

        ::

            - MARKER:TYPe {DELTa|ABSolute}
            - MARKER:TYPe?

        **Info:**
            - ``DELTa`` specifies to display the frequency and amplitude of the markers relative to
              the Reference Marker. The relative amplitude is in dBc (dB below carrier amplitude);
              the relative frequency is in Hz.
            - ``ABSolute`` specifies to display the actual frequency and amplitude of each marker.
              The absolute amplitude is in user-set units; the absolute frequency is in Hz.
