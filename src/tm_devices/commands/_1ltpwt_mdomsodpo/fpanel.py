class FpanelTurn(SCPICmdWrite):
    """The ``FPAnel:TURN`` command.

    **Description:**
        - Simulates the action of turning a specified front-panel control knob. When the front panel
          is locked, the front-panel button and multipurpose knob operations are suspended. The
          ``FPANEL:PRESS`` and commands will also not work, and, they will not generate an error.
          You can work around this by using the appropriate programmatic interface commands, instead
          of the front-panel commands. For example, to set the trigger level to 50%, you could use
          ``TRIGger:A SETLevel``. To force a trigger, you could use TRIGger FORCe.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``FPAnel:TURN value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - FPAnel:TURN <knob>,<n>

    **Info:**
        - ``<knob>`` is the name of a rotating control.
        - ``<n>`` represents the rotation direction and magnitude of rotation. Negative values
          represent a counterclockwise knob rotation, and positive values represent a clockwise
          rotation. The magnitude of <n> specifies the amount of the turn, where <n> = 1 represents
          turning the knob one unit, <n> = 2 represents turning the knob two units, <n> = 4
          represents turning the knob four units, and so on. The range of units depends on which
          front panel knob is specified.
        - ``Multipurpose a`` knob.
        - ``Multipurpose b`` knob.
