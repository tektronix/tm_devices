    """The ``OUTPut:OFF`` command.

    **Description:**
        - This command sets or returns the state (enabled or disabled) of the 'All Outputs Off'
          control. Enabling All Output Off causes each channel's output and markers to go to an
          ungrounded (or open) state. Disabling the control causes each channel to go to its
          currently defined state. A channel's defined state can be changed while the All Outputs
          Off is in effect, but the actual output remains open until the All Outputs Off is
          disabled.

    **Usage:**
        - Using the ``.query()`` method will send the ``OUTPut:OFF?`` query.
        - Using the ``.verify(value)`` method will send the ``OUTPut:OFF?`` query and raise an
          AssertionError if the returned value does not match ``value``.
        - Using the ``.write(value)`` method will send the ``OUTPut:OFF value`` command.

    **SCPI Syntax:**

    ::

        - OUTPut:OFF {0|1|OFF|ON}
        - OUTPut:OFF?

    **Info:**
        - ``0`` or OFF disables the All Output Off function, allowing the channel and marker outputs
          to go to their defined state. 1 or ON enables the All Output Off function, disabling all
          channel outputs and marker outputs.
        - ``*RST`` sets all channels to 0.
