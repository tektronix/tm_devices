"""2400 Series Current Sweep Example Script.

Description:
    This example shows how a user can send a TSP script file from their PC
    to their 2400 Interactive SourceMeter then call its embedded function(s),
    possibly acquiring measurement data. The TSP script file which accompanies
    this code includes a function that performs a 4-wire (or 4-point)
    resistivity measurement on semiconductor wafer material. The application
    note on which the script is based can be found at:
    https://www.tek.com/en/documents/application-note/resistivity-measurements-using-model-2450-sourcemeter-smu-instrument-and-f

    A copy of the TSP script file can be obtained at:
