"""2400 Series Current Sweep Example Script.

Description:
    This sequence of TSP commands makes 100 low-resistance measurements
    by sourcing current and measuring resistance.

    In this example, the source current magnitude and limit voltage
    are set automatically. It uses remote commands to change the
    front-panel display to show the GRAPH swipe screen. This allows
    you to view numeric data at the top of the screen and graphic
    data at the bottom of the screen.

    After the code executes, the data is displayed in console.
