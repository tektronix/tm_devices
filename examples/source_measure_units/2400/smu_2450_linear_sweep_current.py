"""2400 Series Current Sweep Example Script.

Description:
    This Model 2450 example shows you how to sweep the
    test current and measure the resulting voltage drop on a low
    resistance device.

The Model 2450 current source outputs a sweep from -100 mA to 100 mA in 101 steps as the Model 2450
voltmete measures the resulting voltage drop across the resistor.  This application is set up to
take 101 readings with a 100 ms interval time.  Once the measurements are made, the output is turned
off. The current and voltage readings are printed to the Instrument Console.  You can copy and paste
these readings into a spreadsheet for further analysis and graphing.
