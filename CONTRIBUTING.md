# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every bit helps,
and credit will always be given.

## Commit Guidelines

- Commit messages should follow the
  [Angular style](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commit-parsing.html#semantic-release-commit-parser-angularcommitparser).

## Types of Contributions

There are several types of contributions that can be made:

### Report Bugs

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

You can never have enough documentation! Please feel free to contribute to any
part of the documentation, such as the official docs, docstrings, or even on the
web in blog posts, articles, and such.

The docstring and commenting convention this project follows is the
[Google Python styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings)
with a few minor exceptions:

- This project uses imperative-style docstrings (`Fetch rows from a Bigtable.`),
  **not** Google's recommended descriptive-style docstrings
  (`Fetches rows from a Bigtable.`).

### Submit Feedback

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
  welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `tm_devices` for local development.

### Supported IDEs for package development

Currently, autocomplete does not work properly for VS Code in a package
development environment (this does not affect standard pip installs). The
recommended IDE for package development is
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download).

### Setup steps for package development

1. Set up commit signing, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) for details.

   ```{hint}
      All commits going into the main repository are required to be signed, so make sure
      to set up commit signing before starting to make changes.
   ```

2. Fork `tm_devices` into a new repository.

3. Set up a virtual environment and install the project with its dependencies:

   - Using the helper script (recommended):
     ```console
     python scripts/contributor_setup.py
     ```
   - Or manually:
     ```console
     python -m venv .env
     ```
     ```console
     # Linux
     source .venv/bin/activate

     # Windows
     .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
     ```console
     python -m pip install -U pip poetry
     poetry install
     pre-commit install
     ```

4. Use `git` to create a branch for local development and make your changes:

   ```console
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

5. Update the **Unreleased** section in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) using the proper format.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes conform to any code
   formatting requirements and pass any tests.

   ````{note}
      Always remember to activate the virtual environment before attempting to run tests or other code.
      ```console
      # Linux
      source .venv/bin/activate

      # Windows
      .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
      ```
   ````

   - To run full static code analysis, tests, and documentation validation
     (running this prior to opening a pull request is highly recommended, but it is **very slow**):

     ```console
     tox -p
     ```

   - To run just the tests and static code analysis (**much quicker**):

     ```console
     tox -p -m basic
     ```

   - To run just the pre-commit checks:

     ```console
     pre-commit run --all
     ```

   - To run just the tests:

     ```console
     tox -e tests
     ```

   ```{note}
      Two html outputs are generated:

      - Code coverage report: `.results_tests/htmlcov/index.html`
      - Test results: `.results_tests/results.html`
   ```

7. Commit and push your changes, then open a pull request from
   the fork back into the main repository.

   - Commit messages must be structured as follows:
     ```
     <type>[optional scope]: <description>

     [optional body]

     [optional footer(s)]
     ```
   - `<type>` can be one of `fix`, `feat`, `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`,
     `refactor`, or `test`.
   - See the
     [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
     website for more details on this format.

## Updating requirements and commit hooks

To update the required python packages and commit hooks run the following
commands:

````{note}
Always remember to activate the virtual environment before attempting to run tests or other code.
```console
# Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
````

```console
python -m poetry self update

python -m poetry update

pre-commit autoupdate
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include additional tests if appropriate.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should work for all currently supported operating systems
   and versions of Python.
4. The **Unreleased** section in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) should be updated.

## Project Test Plan

This project undergoes rigorous testing to ensure a high quality product.

### All Changes

1. 100% of the source code will have unit tests (except for accepted exceptions)
2. All static code analysis will pass
3. All features will have documentation
4. [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) will be updated
5. Pull requests will have all required approvals prior to merging

### Major Changes

1. Each supported VISA Implementation will be validated as working
2. Each supported Connection Type will be validated as working

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the `tm_devices` project is released with a
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this project you agree
